      <h2>About the Founder</h2>
      
         <p>Hello, I'm Oluwanifemi, the creative behind Loved and Covered. It all started back in my secondary
        school days. I've always loved creating beautiful little things that are both useful
        and beautiful. While learning tailoring then, I would use leftover fabric pieces to make small bow
        scrunchies.
        People loved them. My boss even started adding them as extras for her customers'children, and soon,
        parent began requesting those little scrunchies too.</p>
        
        <p>After I left that place, my sister encouraged me, saying, "why not sell scrunchies?"
            So I did, but I didn't really know how to market back then, and eventually things slowed down.
            earlier this year, I decided to start again. Though it wasn't easy because of online classes, my
            mum helped me sell it among her colleagues. Still, I kept believing in the dream. And now, by 
            God's grace, we're back-stronger and bigger!
            </p>

            <p>My goal is simple:
                To ensure every girl treats her hair like the crown it is - wrapped in comfort, beauty, and 
                love.
                No more tight rubber bands. Just softness. Style. And care - because your hair deserves to be
                Loved & Covered.
